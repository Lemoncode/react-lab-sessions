# 07 Componetize

In this examnple we are going to display an hotel list, we will create viemodels plus mock data to isolate
us from having to access a rest api, and we are going to componentize the solution.

We will take a startup point sample _/day-2/06-global-data_.

Summary steps:

- Start the rest mock server.
- Check the data structure.
- Create the hotel list pod.
- Follow progressive approach, create a viewModel.
- Build up the layout of a single card showing harcoded data.
- Build up the layout of a list of cards showing harcoded data.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) if they are not already installed on your computer.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of the `/day-2/06-global-data` folder to an empty folder for the sample.

- Install the npm packages described in the [./package.json](./package.json) and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
```

- Let's start our rest mock server.

- This server is under the _/backend_ folder, cd into that folder, and execute _npm install_

**from root folder**

```bash
cd backend
```

```bash
npm install
```

- Let's start the mock server.

```bash
npm start
```

- We can open our browser or post man and enter the following url:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/hotels
```

From there we can extract the structure for our front end entities.

- Now we can go back to our front end application.

- Let's create an _hotel-collection_ pod.

- We want to model an hotel card, fields that we want to display:
  - Hotel picture.
  - Hotel name.
  - Hotel description.
  - Hotel rating.
  - Hotel address.

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.vm.ts_

```typescript
export interface HotelEntityVm {
  id: string;
  picture: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rating: number;
  address: string;
}
```

> Note down this is not a 1 to 1 mapping with what we get from the hotel rest api endpoint, that's
> the beauty of view models, define and consume the data you need including names that make sense
> for the domain we are working on.

- Le'ts create the skeleton from the _hotel-collection.container.tsx_, _hotel-collection.component.tsx_,
  _index.ts_

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.component.tsx_

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

export const HotelCollectionComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from collection component</h1>;
};

```

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.container.tsx_

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { HotelCollectionComponent } from './hotel-collection.component';

export const HotelCollectionContainer = () => {
  return <HotelCollectionComponent />;
};

```

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/index.ts_

```tsx
export * from './hotel-collection.container';

```

- Let's instante the _HotelCollectionContainer_ in our hotel collection scene.

_./src/scenes/hotel-collection.scene.tsx_

```diff
import * as React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { linkRoutes } from 'core';
import { AppLayout } from 'layouts';
+ import { HotelCollectionContainer } from 'pods/hotel-collection';

export const HotelCollectionScene = () => (
  <AppLayout>
-   <h2>Hello from Hotel Collection Scene</h2>
-   <Link to={linkRoutes.login}>Navigate to Login</Link>
+   <HotelCollectionContainer />
  </AppLayout>
);

```

- Let's give a try.

```
npm start
```

- Next step let's start building an hotel card:

  - We will use material ui card (https://material-ui.com/demos/cards/).
  - We will create a simple entry just to build the card.
  - Once we are done with the card, we will just create an array of
    hotels and loop through it.

- Let's create some fake data on the _hotel-collection-container_

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.container.tsx_

```diff
import * as React from "react";
import { HotelCollectionComponent } from './hotel-collection.component'
+ import { HotelEntityVm } from './hotel-collection.vm';

+ export const createMockHotelCollection = () : HotelEntityVm[] => ([
+ {
+  "id": "0248058a-27e4-11e6-ace6-a9876eff01b3",
+  "picture": "/thumbnails/50947_264_t.jpg",
+  "name": "Motif Seattle",
+  "description": "With a stay at Motif Seattle, you will be centrally located in Seattle, steps from 5th Avenue Theater and minutes from Pike Place Market. This 4-star hotel is within",
+  "address": "1415 5th Ave",
+  "rating": 4,
+ },
+ {
+  "id": "024bd61a-27e4-11e6-ad95-35ed01160e57",
+  "picture": "/thumbnails/16673_260_t.jpg",
+  "name": "The Westin Seattle",
+  "address": "1900 5th Ave",
+  "description": "With a stay at The Westin Seattle, you'll be centrally laocated in Seattle, steps from Westlake Center and minutes from Pacific Place. This 4-star hotel is close to",
+  "rating": 4,
+},
+]);

export const HotelCollectionContainer = () => {
+ const [hotelCollection, setHotelCollection] = React.useState<HotelEntityVm[]>(
+   createMockHotelCollection()
+ );

  return (
-    <HotelCollectionComponent/>
+    <HotelCollectionComponent hotelCollection={hotelCollection}/>
  );
}
```

- Let's jump into our _HotelCollection_ component, and include this property plus a reference
  to an _HotelCard_ component that we are about to create.

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.component.tsx_

```diff
import * as React from "react";
+ import {HotelEntityVm} from './hotel-collection.vm';
+ import {HotelCard} from './components/hotel-card.component' // on next step we will create this component

+ interface Props {
+  hotelCollection : HotelEntityVm[]
+ }

- export const HotelCollectionComponent = () => {
+ export const HotelCollectionComponent: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = props => {
+  const {hotelCollection} = props;
  return (
-    <h1>Hello from collection component</h1>
+    <HotelCard hotel={hotelCollection[0]}/>
  );
}
```

- Let's create a subfolder called components, and from there we will
  create a component called _hotel-card.component.tsx_

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/components/hotel-card.component.tsx_

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Card from '@material-ui/core/Card';
import { HotelEntityVm } from '../hotel-collection.vm';
import CardHeader from '@material-ui/core/CardHeader/CardHeader';
import Avatar from '@material-ui/core/Avatar/Avatar';
import IconButton from '@material-ui/core/IconButton/IconButton';
import MoreVertIcon from '@material-ui/icons/MoreVert';
import EditIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Edit';
import DeleteIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Delete';
import {
  CardContent,
  CardMedia,
  Typography,
  CardActions,
} from '@material-ui/core';

interface Props {
  hotel: HotelEntityVm;
}

// Todo there are some harcoded styles move them to class styles
export const HotelCard: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = props => {
  const { hotel } = props;

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader
        avatar={<Avatar aria-label="Hotel">{hotel.rating}</Avatar>}
        action={
          <IconButton>
            <MoreVertIcon />
          </IconButton>
        }
        title={hotel.name}
        subheader={hotel.address}
      />
      <CardContent>
        <div
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            flexDirection: 'column',
            justifyContent: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <CardMedia
            image={hotel.picture}
            title={hotel.name}
            style={{ height: 0, paddingTop: '56.25%' }}
          />
          <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
            {hotel.description}
          </Typography>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
      <CardActions>
        <IconButton aria-label="Add to favorites">
          <EditIcon />
        </IconButton>
        <IconButton aria-label="Share">
          <DeleteIcon />
        </IconButton>
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
};

```

- Let's give a try

```
npm start
```

- Not bad we got a nice card but no hotel picture, that is
  because:

a. We are not running our data mock server.

b. Picture are referenced using a relative path we need to
add server prefix.

- To run the mock server go to the root folder of this repo
  cd on _backend_ ensure you have previously executed _npm install_
  under that folder and run:

```bash
npm run start
```

- We have to add now the server prefix to the pictures to
  be displayed:

  - We will define this prefix under _./src/core/const.ts_
  - On a real development instead of harcoding _http://localhost:3000_
    we would just point to environment variables.
  - Then we will expose it under the _common/index.ts_ and update this in the
    viewmodel (later on we will update this on the hotel Entity mapper)

_./src/core/const.ts_

```typescript
export const basePicturesUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';

```

_./src/core/index.ts_

```diff
export * from './routes';
export * from './sessionContext';
+ export * from './const';
```

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.container.tsx_

```diff
...
+ import { basePicturesUrl } from 'core';

export const createMockHotelCollection = () : HotelEntityVm[] => ([
{
  "id": "0248058a-27e4-11e6-ace6-a9876eff01b3",
-  "picture": "/thumbnails/50947_264_t.jpg",
+  "picture": `${basePicturesUrl}/thumbnails/50947_264_t.jpg`,
  "name": "Motif Seattle",
  "description": "With a stay at Motif Seattle, you will be centrally located in Seattle, steps from 5th Avenue Theater and minutes from Pike Place Market. This 4-star hotel is within",
  "address": "1415 5th Ave",
  "rating": 4,
},
{
  "id": "024bd61a-27e4-11e6-ad95-35ed01160e57",
-  "picture": "/thumbnails/16673_260_t.jpg",
+  "picture": `${basePicturesUrl}/thumbnails/16673_260_t.jpg`,
  "name": "The Westin Seattle",
  "address": "1900 5th Ave",
  "description": "With a stay at The Westin Seattle, you'll be centrally laocated in Seattle, steps from Westlake Center and minutes from Pacific Place. This 4-star hotel is close to",
  "rating": 4,
},
]);
```

- Great we a single hotel being displayed, how could
  we get displayed the list of hotels? We only need to
  add a _map_ sentence to our _hotelCollectionComponent_
  and display as much cards as items we have.

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.component.tsx_

```diff
interface Props {
  hotelCollection: HotelEntityVm[];
}

export const HotelCollectionComponent = (props: Props) => {
  const { hotelCollection } = props;

- return <HotelCard hotel={hotelCollection[0]} />;
+ return (
+   <>
+     {hotelCollection.map(hotel => (
+       <HotelCard key={hotel.id} hotel={hotel} />
+     ))}
+   </>
+ );
};

```

- Not bad we got the list being displayed, but... it needs some CSS magic to make it look perfect, let's pimp a bit the UI.

- Instead of using inline styles we are going to start CSS in JS, let's first configure this for the
  _HotelCollectionComponent_ (use Hoc to inject styles into the component and add typing for that types
  by adding them to the props interface).

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/hotel-collection.component.tsx_

```diff
import * as React from "react";
+ import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import { HotelEntityVm } from "./hotel-collection.vm";
import { HotelCard } from "./components/hotel-card.component"; // on next step we will create this component

+ const useStyles = makeStyles({
+ });

interface Props {
  hotelCollection: HotelEntityVm[];
}

export const HotelCollectionComponent: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = props => {
  const { hotelCollection } = props;
+ const classes = useStyles(props);

  return (
    <>
      {hotelCollection.map(hotel => (
        <HotelCard hotel={hotel} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
};
```

- Let's start by adding a flex layout to the list of cards.

```diff
const useStyles = makeStyles({
+ listLayout: {
+   display: 'flex',
+   flexWrap: 'wrap',
+   justifyContent: 'space-between',
+ }
});



export const HotelCollectionComponent: React.FunctionComponent<
  Props
> = props => {
  const { hotelCollection } = props;
  const classes = useStyles(props);

  return (
-   <>
+   <div className={classes.listLayout}>
      {hotelCollection.map(hotel => (
        <HotelCard key={hotel.id} hotel={hotel} />
      ))}
-   </>
+   </div>
  );
};
```

- Let's jump into the card itself and define a card width and height.

_./src/pods/hotel-collection/components/hotel-card.component.tsx_

```diff
import * as React from 'react';
+ import { makeStyles, Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

 interface Props {
  hotel: HotelEntityVm;
}

+ const useStyles = makeStyles((theme : Theme) => ({
+     card: {
+       width: '500px', // rather be rem?
+       marginTop: theme.spacing(2)
+     },
+   }));


export const HotelCard: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = props => {
  const {hotel} = props;
+ const classes = useStyles(props);

  return (
-  <Card>
+  <Card className={classes.card}>
  // (...)
  </Card>
)
}
```

# Excercises

- Move all the inline styling to CSS in JS.
- Componentize the card (if not done before).
